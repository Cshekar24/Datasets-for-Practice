0,"Got this pice of machine delivered right next day of ordering. Amazing delivery service by Amazon. The product packaging was factory sealed. Now, coming to the important points below:1. This feels a bit larger than it should be. Finishing is good but the front panel is glossy fiber. Hence fingerprint magnet.2. You now have the ability to increase or decrease the micro power.3. The clock gets reset every time you switch it off from board. Idk why they've included it.4. Deodorizer feature is a good one.5. The final and most important: SAMSUNG IS BRANDING THIS PRODUCT AS CURD/DOUGH MAKER. THEY'VE MADE A DEDICATED BUTTON FOR THIS PURPOSE BUT THIS MODEL TAKES AROUND 6-9 HOURS TO PROCESS CURD WITH THE PRESET MENU PROVIDED. Where other Samsung models are taking 35 mins to process same amount of curd. What is the meaning of this joke Samsung? Mix a tablespoon of curd with a bowl of milk, it'll take max 4-5 hrs to get a bowlfull of nice curd, naturally. Why I'll run this monster overnight to get this? THIS FEATURE IS JUST A CHEAP MARKETING GIMMICK!!This is just from my Day1 observation. Will update you guys if I get to find more.",4.4
1,"Product was okay, but amazon is not providing the accessories mentioned.I've not received ""1 Crusty Plate, 1 Power Steam Bowl"".Customer service is worst no one is picking call whenever I'm trying to lodge complain.",4.0
2,They say it's touch panel. It's not. Hiding buttons behind glossy panel doesn't mean it's touch panel. You have to press buttons litterally. Recieved a small body part broken but didn't return because it's kind of hidden and not impacting the actual work a oven do.Otherwise so far it's working good. Happy to have it that way. They could have installed a time chip the time shown by own always resets to 12 on power cut. I mean how much it costs to do such kind of things but these people are more into gettign more money :P,1.0
3,"Ordered on 3rd October delivered on 7th October.....packing was good .....but one crusty plate and steam bowl was not there.😨😨But,it was clearly mentioned on the product page.",4.0
4,"my product from amazon was very good they have delivered in time.my oven is working very,they have delivered safe in condition. but services from samsung was very bad my oven was delivered a week ago but samsung services was not responding properly. i have contaced to samsung services they not responding properly,this kind of services taking samsung brand products are not worth,verys dissapointed with samsung.",4.0
5,"This Samsung Owen with convection, grill and microwave option is very handy and easy to use without any guidance. Though samsung is providing demo by thier local service executive to the purchaser within a week of its delivery.I got this for an offer price. So at this price point it's very much in a value for money category. Overall good experience so far with 3 months of usage. Also recommend to few of my friends who where looking for a good oven.",2.0
6,"We rarely use this microwave, like only for warming food during winters and cake baking at b'day occasion but after one year,Several internal parts got fused and one of the part ""magnetron"" which suppose to be in guaranteed for 5 years, was damaged and service engineer from samsung is charging Rs 2,100 and is not availing guarantee.  Also charging too much for other damaged inside parts.BAD COMPANY AFTER SALES SERVICE",3.0
7,"Didn't provide crusty plate and Power steam bowl. Feeling utterly disappointed,  didn't know if Cloudtail India could go this low.Now I have to purchase it from mrkt, which will cost me  ₹1000 more.😣😣",3.0
8,Please do not buy this. My turntable was broken. It doesn’t turn. Sometimes it starts move and some times it doesn’t. Heat in the oven is also not good. I did a test too. I made a 2 kg batter for chocolate cake. Baked one kg in this oven and another kg in my aunt’s oven. Her cake was all good. Mine got burnt outside and didn’t cook in the inside. The worst product I’ve got delivered by amazon.Take my suggestionMove on***do not buy this***Amazon people didn’t even allow me to return or exchange this.I am so frustrated.My 8000 went straight down dustbin.,4.0
9,"When you buy for 8415, you can't deny the value for money.Package looked mishandled by the courier but the product was well packed it didn't have any dents or scratches.It has all the basic things required for a microwave.Few things which could have been better,Door lock looks weak. May wear and tear sooner when frequently opened and closed.Buttons are not soft and not hard. Kind of confused pressing everytime.If you use microwave occasionally, this might be the best option.If you are planning to use often like office microwaves. May be you have to think a little.",5.0

   The Ceramic cavity by far more most reliable and uniform cooking oven . Extremely easy to clean and the food cooks healthy . The functions are easy to use and the machine is extreme reliable .

12,"I got it in Amazon Prime sale. The delivery was as smooth as Amazons. The Samsung installation technician was lined up for next day of delivery, he came in and gave the demo, ofcourse for free.Coming to the product, its just superb. Ive baked cookies, tandoori, cakes and papad in it. Just perfection. The microwave option does its part every day as well. There are 2 different level steel grills with the oven, and the rotating disk inside. Ive seen complaints regarding some crusty bowl but neither was it promised to me nor did I get it in delivery so theres not duping of any sort. Its just a fantastic product from a reputed manufactured and sold by Samsung themselves, listed on a genuine site. Just go for it! I got some solid discount in sale + no cost EMI, cant refuse such a deal haha!",1.0
13,"I bought this for my parent's house and i was using a similar product from Samsung for last 4years without any problem. The product is of very good quality which is evident from the zero issues that we faced in last 4 years.The program panel is very intuitive and easy to use (entering time for long time baking is bit difficult, since the time increment is 10secs).The one that we purchased now heats up a bit more than the one i bought 4yrs back.But all in all very happy with the product & its quality.",4.0
14,"I personally think that Samsung is the Best Available Option in India on all grounds.. But after all it's represented locally by the Local Service Center Goons (Yes it's Goons) and unless they are not willing to give good service a Good Company will also not succeed.. I think Samsung has to do some Research at my Location about how much Business does it do directly and indirectly..Another thing I'm very much disappointed about is the LENGTH OF POWER CABLE.. Whether it's Mobile Charger or any other product, there must be some Standards about the same. Formerly I had an IFB MW and then I bought this.. Now I'll have to reorganise the Electricals ONLY because the length of the Power Cable..My advice to Samsung is a Famous Proverb in Gujarati Language which means that YOU CANNOT REDUCE THE WEIGHT OF A CORPSE BY REMOVING ITS PUBIC HAIR..Thanks..",4.4
15,The only negative about this product is that the door locks of this oven the two clip is made out of plastic.Should be careful while using it any harsh closing or opening of this product may damage its lock and Samsung doesn't provide warranty to the plastic items on the ovenOther than this it's a great oven best at this price point,4.0
16,"The product is good but I have issues with the handling of items by the amazon delivery agents. I saw the box was almost thrown on ground from the delivery van. Then it was dragged and rolled by the delivery person to bring in my apartment (all thanks to cctv). Also the microwave was in its standard packaging provided by the manufacturer, amazon didn't provide its additional layer of packaging which its normally does. Luckily the product was not damaged and was in good condition so I kept it. I would request the amazon officials to look into these kind of issues wherein the there is a risk of receiving a damaged product due to somme careless behavoiur of delivery agents.Apart from the delivery issues, the product is good. All the three modes i.e. Microwave, Convection ang Grill work fine. Although there is some scope of improvement for Grill mode but at this price point you can't expect too much.",1.0

19,"It's good for its price.It doesn't have buttons to press exact minutes for cooking, instead u need to long press to reac to desire minutes, it wastes so much time to do so.Max convention temp is only 200 degree C.Others are all good.",5.0

25,"I bought this laptop about a month ago.This is my first laptop as I used tablets earlier. To be honest I have never experienced such a worst experience before, I use this mainly to attend online classes and watch YouTube. Even when not in use the idle ram usage is very high.Although it says it has 500mb vram. The maximum fps I get is 10-15 on a very low end game. Thinking this might be the issue with my current software (windows 10) I upgraded it to windows 11 which made it a little better but still not upto expectations. If you wanna buy this laptop even after all these issues I suggest u to upgrade its ram which even requires an extra 3-4k. There is a lot of good laptops out there for these prices. I am giving 5 star so u see this review on top",4.0

Whoever said you can't play gta said it totally wrong.But one thing to remember this lqptop isn't build for gaming this is a office uses laptop so don't expect too high gaming. It work woth average gaming if you want to buy only for gaming then go for ryzen 5, i5 or more. Below ryzen 5 and i5 this one stands out it is faster than i3 and ryzen 3",2.0

1,"After using for more than 2 day's I must say, snapdragon 730g works wonderful .CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mega Pixcel and more feature in selfie camera.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M51 feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. 6.7 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.",5.0
2,"My take after using the handset for 4 days:1. Display: Superb. Big, crystal clear, bright and everything you can expect from a samsung super amoled plus screen.2. Camera: Very good. Night mode could have been better.3. Sound: Speakers: Better than average, earphones: good4. Battery: Very good. But expected more backup from a 7000 mah battery. Had to charge it once a day for the last 4 days.5. UI: The one-ui provided here is different from the one provided in A series. The one that comes with A series phones like A50 etc is more user friendly and has more features like Secure folder, timer etc. Also, the Samsung notes app in A series is far better than the one provided here. In this price, an UI at par with the leading A series phones is expected.6. Processor: Good for normal use.7. Finger print unlock is fast and smooth.8. No case/ back cover and no earphone.9. A bit overpriced.",1.0
3,"I have been using this from starting. Ordered on 18th sep and get this phone very next day 19th. Here is my overall review.1. Battery - tremendous and optimization is on next level2. Display - It's great display ever.3. Speed - faster then ever ( compared to my other phones )4. Gaming - Very powerful no laging ( played COD, Hitman Sniper, Asphalt 9)But wait, in the meantime I've faced some issues on the phone as well.1. Voice call - call is fine but when call is placed on speaker children voice could not be heard by other. On normal call it's perfect but on speaker it's not. Adult voice can be heard from a distance but children voice can't. even the phone is just near the face. This issue can lead you the problem while you're on whatsapp video call as well. First I thought it was just whatsapp issue but after certain test it's major issue on voice call. Tested with safe mode and also after factory reset (without any other third party applications)2. Fingerprint sensor - It's fine and fast. But wait. you need to setup both hands fingers so it's easy to use. Maybe if the finger print sensor placed on in-display then it's better than this but if you map with both hand fingers and thumb then it's easy. Other wise you've to wait for 30 seconds if the finger not matched for 5 times.3. Galaxy Apps - Disable it otherwise unnecessary apps and bloatware will be install automatically.4. Knox - It's displaying secured by Knox but secure folder is not there. Which should be.I have replaced the product but still the microphone issue is there so plz be carefull with this.",5.0

7,"I have ordered this mobile on the first day of the sale at 12 o clock sharp. Yes there are some good features, But let's talk only about the CONS. The reason for talking about the CONS as the PROS are talked by other friends.  1) Vibration of the mobile is more and can't hold the mobile for longer time.  2) Mobile is higher priced compared to other same configuration devices and no tempered glass or case has been provided.  3) Guys Please check the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR Value) before buy any mobile and in this its more which affects Head and Body and not good for health.  4) Weight of the mobile is MORE and finally I won't recommend this.",5.0

9,"First impressions: the celestial black colour looks really good and elegant. Looks better than in pics or videos. The phone feels solid in hand. The screen is large and great quality punchy colors. The screen is also very bright.Performance too seems good except that the real performance will be known a while later as Samsung mobile tend to slow down with time. The back is a fingerprint magnet, so a case is a must.The battery is really a beast and charger is decent too. Battery easily lasts 2 days with average use, even with heavy use it lasts one and a half days.Camera Performance is great at this price. The pictures and videos come out great.I got the 6gb variant with hdfc offer and with HDFC smart buy, the price should come down to 22000. Its a great phone at this price. Most of the cons mentioned in online reviews are not for me. I am happy with this phone.Why I preferred M51 over Nord? M51 ticks all the right boxes for me. A great screen for watching videos, good casual gaming, a great battery lasting at least 2 days, a better camera, 128 gb storage with microsd card support  and at a price which is Rs. 3000  cheaper. I already have Samsung and Oneplus phones at home. So I can say with confidence that you won't go wrong with any of the brand.My overall first impression is that its a great phone with almost all things that one may need at this price. Will keep updating.",2.0

Snapdragon 730G optimized very well.Processor is snappy.Compared to other brands (realme 7 pro, one plus nord), it gives faster perfomance as it has been properly optimized.4. Battery is the top selling point for this phone.I have to take office calls for 5/6 hours a day, including webex meetings with wifi always on.It still last me 1.5 days.5. Display is excellent even though it is providing 60 hz refresh rate.Amoled display of samsung is brilliant as always.Cons:1. Back is plastic. Does feeling like a 25k phone.But as 7000mah battery had to be adjusted in a compact way, samsung had to compromise  with the design.2. 4k/1080p videos can't  record in 60fps.Doesn't  bother me much, it depends on your preference.",1.0
14,"Samsung delivered defective piece and had to gone through replacement cycle. Believe me, on Amazon getting replacement is not easy.  It was a manufacturing defect.Do see your phone thoroughly, as soon as you receive to check for defect.*** Amazon has no return policy on electronic items, even if product is damaged. They dont care. ***Finally after getting product :Camera, User Interface : GoodHeavy (because of mega battery). Its a big phone, so personally I am not finding it handy.Battery life : still need to find.",3.0
15,"This is the best phone in 25000 segment  730G processor with 7000 mah battery with 25w fast chargingThe display quality is amazing as it is S amoled panelThe 64 mp camera captures amazing details it also has night mode and slowmo, hyperlapse, one take, macro camera is not good tho . It tried fortnite it can run on medium graphics with 30fps limit and its pretty smooth thanks to 730G . The front facing camera quality is very good  i have attached pic of  ram usuage with no background app running one thing i didnt like was u cannot zoom in when u set to 64mp camera mode and it is filled with unnecessary apps like daily hunt and many others",5.0

17,"Well, as compared to the same feature range phones. The price seems to be 2-3k high. But if you are bored of charging your phone every 6 hours, you have a relief here with 7000 mAh battery, which doesn't  disappoint you.  I choose primarily for the battery and it lived up to the point that it stated. With playing 1 hour of playing COD, using hotspot for a full day and browsing it lasted for more then 40 hours and there is a battery saver mode too, which will last for a week if you are travelling out and need to use phone for only call and minimum usage.But, if you are a non-stop gamer it will last a day depending on the usage.Pros:Display is good, performance is fine, battery is stand out. The camera is also good and bixby vision is cool. Many edited features come with the camera, that is added advantage. Sensors are good and fast too. The weight is well balanced, you won't feel the weight after a day's usage. Charging is quite quick. Rest of phone's features are fine.Cons:Plastic built body, no tempered glass or case is provided within the box. The speakers are located at the bottom which is uncomfortable if we hold the phone in two hands and watch videos or play games. In dark, the screen display may cause some burden to the eyes, which I did not face earlier. The background apps keeps running until you close them or optimize the battery which will automatically close all the background running appVerdict:Little high-priced, very good battery and a satisfactory performance.",5.0

Stunning display amoled at its best..watched Enola holmes3. need back cover else scratches will be evident glaringly and lose its premium feelMost important worrying fact is SAR value at 1.3, the only fact I am disappointed with samsung..u can check dailling *#07#..ps samsung are valued for low sarAudio loud speaker I am not satisfied",1.0
19,"I have been using Samsung Phones ever since they ventured into Smart Phones. I had privilege of using majority of Samsung Phones like Galaxy S2, Samsung Grand, Samsung S6, Samsung S9+, Samsung Note 3 and Samsung S10.When Samsung launched M51, like many I think I am also fooled by aggressive marketing campaign and youtube reviews by youtubers like Technical Guruji (I unsubscribed his channel due to fraud review)Why I purchased this phone because ofBrand SamsungExpected Good Camera SetupExpected Good Build QualityExpected Good PackagingAnd for this I have paid good price of INR 25KWhy I am disappointedBuild quality is quite inferior it's cheap plastic that use to come in phones like Karbon or Lava in 2012-2013.Camera setup is quite average, they say it's triple camera but picture quality is not so great, night shots are average, I think if you buy brands like Xiaomi you get better pictures by spending less amount. Probably that's why Samsung is marketing Single Take feature, which I think won't work if camera is average.Packaging, after paying INR 25K one expects box to include stuff like Phone Cover as these days majority of manufacturers, but here it comes with cheap quality of Box, that has nothing but a cheap charger with very poor quality of packaging, now a days many manufacturers are also putting the screen protectors at cheap cost, Samsung should take a note.Phone weighs quite heavy and is not easy to use with one hand, this is something nobody is telling, probably thats the only reason Samsung has degraded the build quality.What is good about this phoneBattery - Certainly that's the only feature for which I paid INR 25K. But are you willing to pay this much for a phone that's more of power bank.Headphone Jack - Samsung has retained it, and it's output is pretty good.Apart from that phone has same processor like Samsung A80, which comes with better camera setup and better build quality.Therefore I feel Samsung is over charging customers for this device and it should not cost more then INR 15K - 18K.So if you are only looking for battery and headphone jack then spend money on this one and If anyone wants to contact me I am ready to resell mine at 20%  discount.I wish they had option of giving zero stars.Amazon I am sorry this is my worst ever Amazon shopping experience which I regret everyday when I see what I got.",1.0
20,"Huge battery backup 7000mAh, 64mp Sony camera with other wide angle and selfie camera, fast snapdragon 730g makes the purchase worthy plus the introductory  card offers, although 24k is better bet for provided feature. Samsung should attempt at providing back cover plus screen protector if charging extra bucks extra along with some features of knoxx security( nfc is old)... Side mounted finger print scanner is regular type and not that fast or secure as I expected. Pride of holding an Indian assembled non Chinese phone from a leading global brand, Glad to return back to Samsung as my earlier experience of choppy display and heating  phone was horribleSound volume is not that comparable to a 25k or 27k phone, exclusive C type double ended usb is difficult  in connecting to some other set of devices( may be I'm feeling new as I upgraded from lenovo k6 after 4 years),M51 is a choice for someone not finding enough time to charge in between his day job and this phone charges in just 115 mins approx from 0-100% and about 30-35% in 30 mins . Monstrous capacity even with heavy use",4.0
21,"Buying phone at 25k, with better than this features available for 18k from Chinese Mobiles companies.. Just coz Samsung not Chinese. But is Samsung misusing Indians sentiments? Then what  when others are providing Gorilla Glass 5 front and Back.. This Samsung is giving plastic back, which easily get scratches and least bothered of phone maintainance. Atleast they could have provided back cover worth of Rs.50/- which is absense. Samsung is so harsh on customer paying 25k for his phone. This will not run for long. We don't brother buying Chinese phone if this attitude continues. Indian need to think. Chinese mobile companies manufacturing mobiles in India.. Also they are giving jobs to our people and many families are running.Why should be bothered, one who doesn't care of their customers.",5.0

Hope to either get it fixed, or get a replacement soon. They told me it could take upto 10 days.",5.0
23,"Pros-Side Finger print is superfast but face unlock takes a bit time.-Bezel less n punch hole display looks cool from front.-Camera clarity is nice but doesn't  reproduce natural color.- Battery seems to be working 2 days but not more than that.- Front camera is awesome.-Phone is nice but not worth 25KCons:-Major Heating  issues when using camera...a big drawback.-Display quality is just like normal Amoled...no improvements . They just name it blah blah blah....marketing strategy.- Camera focus hunting issues.- Pathetic speaker, neither bass nor clarity and not so loud. Call quality is also not upto mark.-Position of volume button is very inconvenient, it is on the upper half side which causes difficulty in single hand use.-Very bad and thin quality of type C charger cable which can not last longer than a year.-ONE UI:-So far I didn't  find camera shutter sound off button .- noticed no lag in UI but obviously not superfast, feels some stuttering while browsing in play store.- No shortcuts of clock/calendar on notification bar. By clicking  on it, clock/calendar should open, thats very handy.Thats 24 hour user review. I will update my findings accordingly.",1.0
24,"Well first disclaimer - nothing is perfect in world, so is M51 (or for that matter any other phone). But M51 actually ticks all right boxes at given price. Let me give an honest and personal opinion. Before that let me share that I bought this phone for my college going son. I'm a Note user since last 3yrs, so would be a candid review.Best things :1. Battery - With more and more screen time, you need a reliable battery life. 7k battery gives you excellent juice to do more without draining soon. Charging is fast so far. No heating witnessed.2. Screen - Samsun screens are no doubt the best ones. Super Amoled used here is treat to eyes.3. Camera - truly truly marvellous. I can't just believe the camera department in M51. Sony hardware is well oiled and you get crystal crisp pictures. Amazing pic quality.4. Weight to me is not that bulky given a big screen and bigger battery you need to run that for 2 days, unplugged.Improvement areas :1. Dolby atmos is excellent in headphones but stock speaker could have been better, though not disappointing.2. There are no headphone, cover and screen guard in the box. All that are well informed earlier, so least surprises. Negligible costs and many good options available in market. BTW I use Spigen case and super awesome on M51. very very secure.All in all a very good phone, ticks all compartments right. Go for it w/o thoughts. And the best things, Non Chinese brand. Samsung has come up with one of the largest mobile plant at Noida in India. So another right tick.",5.0

26,I bought this phone after lot of researchBut it disheartened me lot.After 10days of normal use it is not starting and charging. Also I got overheating issue right from day one.I never thought of this situation. Also it is not returnable after 7days.Please don't buy they launched without quality check. It failed on my expectations.,1.0
27,"Just got it in my hands a few hours back. The big display and battery are just amazing.  The phone is slightly thick yet very slim when you consider the monster battery. Camera looks good for day photography. Yet to use it in night conditions. First impressions??Awesome for the price!Adding to the previous review.The battery life is great n as advertised.Camera quality is very decent for the price. The fingerprint reader is okayish.Overall, very satisfied with the Monster phone!!",3.0
28,"I bought this phone(8 gb/128 gb variant)on the very first day of the sale and i got this at 24999/-₹ instead of regular price of 26999/-₹ with HDFC Card offer.... and i think that this phone is somewhat overpriced and the 24999/-₹ should be the real price for 8gb/128gb variant..Now coming to this phone i would like to say that this phone is packed with nice features and a monstrous battery but disappoints in build quality parameter and it has full plastic body and only comes with Gorilla glass 3 protection...Samsung should have given atleast Gorilla glass 5 protection if they didn't want to give glass body but i only bought this phone as i didn't want to buy a Chinese phone and only wanted a non chinese Made in India phone so this was my only option....Now i will give a few Pros and Cons of this after using it for non stop 4 days.....Pros:1. I found that its Camera is good for casual photogaphy with good low light performance,it is the same camera which comes with M31s and i think most of the persons will like its performance..2. It is packed with 7000 mah battery and will last uptp 2 days with moderate use (not heavy gaming)....3. Samumg One UI is awesome with some preloaded application and it also comes with knox security which gives hassle free experience and peace of mind and it is specially optimised for this to work with Snapdragon 730g(although it is cut down variant of One UI which samsung only gives in its flagship phones and A series)..4. Now for the very first time after 2-3 years samsung fixed a Snapdragon processor in its phone and earlier it was giving same old exynos 9611 in most of its phones....it comes with a Snapdragon 730g processor with an antutu score of approx 270k and geekbench score of approx 1700 and performance wise it is very good and one can easily play pubg in ultra settings with 35-40 fps and with 8 gb ram it works blazingly fast and makes multi tasking easier....5.It comes with a 6.7"" AMOLED plus infinity-O full HD display and only downside is that it doesn't comes with Gorilla glass 5 protection and is only 60hz display other competitors give 90hz display with Gorilla glass 5 at the same price...Cons:1. It is made up of only plastic and is susceptible to damage if handled roughly and the side of the phone and even buttons are fully plastic atleast they should have given aluminium finish on buttons and on its sides..2.It has a toned down version of One UI so if someone wants to enjoy its full features then he has to look for A series...and this phone also comes with some bloatwares and also automatically starts downloading recommended application from galaxy store without user permission as soon as it connects internet....3.I think it is priced 1500-2000/-₹ over its real price and which gives chinese phones an edge over it in terms of pricing..4.The phone only comes with an adapter only 25 watts and a type c to c charging cable...i think samsung has tried to cut the cost wherever possible..i think it could have been better if samsung supplied this phone with a back cover and pre applied screen guard with atleast 30 watt charging adapter...Vivo,realme,Oppo etc.all are giving the things that i have mentioned above at the price less than this phone...5.A 90 hz display with Gorilla glass 5 protection could have been better fit for this phone so one should buy a rugged back cover and a decent tempered glass to avoid any damage.....Now i have to say that it is a good phone but it is overpriced and most the of the persons will prefer realme,oppo,vivo etc. But if anyone wants a non chinese phone with a good better User experience then they should definitely look at this phone....",3.0

37,Ok here we go! First review for the meanest monster!I think I was the first who got this delivered from Amazon!So below are my initial impressions:1. Screen - Massive. Simply massive! Great colors and that slight curve edges feel premium.2. Build - Nothing cheap here. Feels sturdy and has good weight distribution. But definitely not for small hands.3. UI - Easy to browse and navigate yet feature rich. Goodness of one UI4. Performance - Already installed around 100 apps. No lag noticed till date. No slowness at all. And I didn't miss 90hz refresh rate!5. Camera - Not much testing with the cam yet. But the selfie cam seems quite interesting. Has great details.6. Battery - Its just 2days but I can see the enormous potential here. Got awesome 9+ hours of SOT on first charge despite all that app download n sync with accounts.7. Network - No issues here. Better internet speed and coverage than my last phone for sure. Call connectivity feels good till nowWill update further by the end of this week.Do comment your questions here if any.,5.0
38,I have used redmi k20 previously. But the super AmoLED display in this m51 was awesome. Atlast my wish was fullfilled to experience the Samsung's display. That's all because of the Snapdragon 730. If they have choosen Exynos processor again I would have not taken this mobile. And the fingerprint scanner was superfast. It has an super touch response. Just with a small touch phone unlocks immediately. No delays. If you want an mobile for entertainment this was the right choice with big screen. Audio was good. I'm using boat airdopes 441 pro with this mobile. sound effects and quality was awesome.,1.0

You have to enter your pin all the time.And why this nonsense ONE UI @Samsung ? why can't you just keep stock android, it low your cost and you can sell your phones at low cost.Because of this mistake I am giving it one star over all.

44,"After 3 days of use i am writing this review.The best phone from samsung at this budget.1.CAMERA- camera is very very good. Rear camera you can use in 64 MP for Full crystal clear photos. Videos, hylerlaps and slomos are very good. MACRO CAMERA AND WIDE CAMERA are also very good. You will enjoy the camera photos.2. Bettery life- From the 20% of charging to reach 80% its just charge in less then 60 minutes . I charge my phone in the morning around 80-90% and i use my phone all the day in online lectures and webinares and my internet is continuos whole the day still at the evening it left with 50-55% charging then again i play the cod mobile at night for 2-3 hours still it lest 25% bettery and another day morning i charge the phone for one hour and it goes to 90% in just one hour. So superb bettery life.Performance - Snapdragon 730G and Adreno 618 GPu gives you outstanding performance and more power saving beacuse of its superamoled plus infinity display. I play cod mobile in High graphics and exterme frame rate but its never lag and phone has no heating compare to other phones. I LOVE THE PERFORMANCE.Display- Everyone know in the display no one can beat the samsung its just awsome for watching movies and also gives you DOLBY Atmos so you will love the watching series and movies on it.I think Paisa vasool phone he guys and made in india he Noida, delhi (samsung's world's largest manufacturing plant) just buy it.

47,"This phone came with a lot of hype and I exchanged my One Plus 5T for this phone. The reason for exchanging my old phone was frequent battery drain on my 5t.However, the firat thing to point out is m51 has a 7000mah battery but in use it does not feel so. My 3yr old 5t required me to charge 3-4times in a day but my new m51 requires a charge once a day, which I did not expect from a brand new 7000mah battery.The touch response is laggy on m51 and I really do not like this after using 5t even though this has a better cpu and 8gb ram compared to my older 5t.The Samsung oneUI is ugly at best when compared to stock android and Oxygen OS.Overall, its just another 25k phone, nothing great about it and this is no game changer.",4.0

   Reviews should be honest and unbiased, and I'll live up to this. For me, any smartphone should be reviewed based on what ""should be"" its experience after 1-2 years and not when immediately purchased. But of course, potential buyers will buy it soon after its release - hence I'm reviewing it now based on my 1 week's observation. Will try to keep it short.1. Go through the attached video to see overall exterior features and first look towards the screen fluidity (video was taken from Z1 pro).2. Processor is more than fine for me - 730G is pulling off all my tasks at max speed. Including a lot of games like Clash Royale, Asphalt 9 and others with zero lag.3. Heating - strangely, phone doesn't heat up during gaming (maybe max 2-3 dgr more) and charging but heats up a lot during prolonged voice calls.4. Cellular call quality & speaker sound o/p quality are at par with any flagship performance.5. Battery calibration - in last 7 DAYS, I've charged it from 0 or 5% to 100% TWICE and haven't charged otherwise at all. I'm getting SoT of 12.5+ hours with medium gaming and a lot of cellular calls. I have uninstalled most of the bloatware except Samsung care and have installed 182 user apps as of this moment.This reading is, given:i. You give up fast charging - disable fast charging from device care menu (takes exactly 3 hr 7 min everytime from 1% to 100%)ii. Charge your phone while it's switched off.iii. Utilise the phone's default sleep and deep sleep mode configurations to hibernate apps. No need of greenify/ccleaner/avast/bla blaiv. Use device care function to kill background apps when not in use. Use system-wide dark modes as much as possible.v. Don't overuse/abuse power-saving mode.vi. Disable notifications of apps you don't really need.vii. limited Always-On display (on touch only)6. I miss an imp function - call recording from default dialer - struggled a lot to find the right free app - ACR dialer pro for manual call rec (update: using Showcaller now)7. I like the Dolby atmos mode on headsets (it's a headset-only mode) but it's not as powerful as some of the other chinese models with Dolby. But all lows, mids and highs are soothing and base is balanced.8. I miss the notification light.9. The entire phone is optimised to let you realise the entire 6800 mAh inside. The refresh and touch sampling rates are low, display dpi is less, core UI 2.0 is perfectly optimised and even the game launcher and plugins don't use many cores. My requirement was never more than a 60hz refresh, so I'm not missing anything here.10. Yes, the ""glastic"" term is a gimmick indeed, but as you'll all use a case at some point of time or the other in the future, the accusation is baseless, I feel. Gorilla glass is again another gimmick - if your phone has to break, it will.11. A small factor but yet an annoying one for me is the rear lens pinhole positioning. 3 of the 4 pinholes are asymmetrically cut and you can notice it easily if you hold the back against the light for at least 5 secs. (check the video). Maybe only for my set, but a factor.12. I had accidentally dropped it (with case and no tempered glass) the next day it was delivered from my trouser's pocket. not even a scratch came anywhere on the plastic or glass parts.13. Except when you expressly want to feel the weight, the set does not ""feel"" heavy. Good weight distribution despite being 210+ gms.14. Side-mounted bio sensor is first time for me but I've gotten quickly used to it - only persistent issue you may face is the notification panel scrolling down while gaming - unless you disable the feature. The sensor is extremely responsive (check video). (update: picking up the phone very often unlocks it as the sensor is exactly at the place on the side where one would unintentionally touch to pick it up)15. Ambient light sensor - major disadvantage. After the last OTAdate, it's currently using the front lens to sense luminosity, which is battery intensive. And STILL, the screen light flickers randomly. Hoping a very quick OTAdate to handle this. M51 supports Knox3.5  but there is no folder for it provided. Deployment failed. (Update: Screen flickering is fixed!! We also HAVE SECURE FOLDER NOW!!)16. Except the depth lens, all the other lenses are working fine for me. The selfie lens could be much better considering its 8mp main sensor - selfie pic attached. The PRO mode steals the game, at least for me though the 12mp ultra-wide lens also doesn't disappoint. The macro lens is fantastic (check pic detail of palm)PROS:1. Dedicated SD slot till 512 gigs2. Awesome battery, no complaints, delivers spec-wise.3. Great SA+ display with deep blacks. I love the warm tinge - tilts it towards reading mode4. Sturdy build despite being plastic - it also accounts for the less weight bcz it's plastic (7000mAh?!)5. Promising 16mp main Sony and 5mp macro sensors6. Performance is top-notch - no stutter, fps drop, fc, thanks to Snappy kyro golds and silvers.7. A finely power-optimised, feature-packed GUI.8. Inbuilt sleep and deep-sleep modes (droid default)9. Super slo-mo, hyperlapse, AR, PRO, single take, live focus, night mode - useful presets present. 4K recording@30fps - super-steady recording.10. UI - system-wide dark mode, wifi calling, NFC, screen recording inbuilt, widevine L1 for FHD clips, fullscreen gestures with hidden nav bar11. It's a ""NON-CHINESE"" smartphone, many system info apps say it's manufactured in Noida - take your call.12. Reverse-charging support is there (usb type c)13. Screenshot shortcut - swipe palm 'edge' from right to left by just touching the screen14. ""Adaptive battery mode"" (droid default) - pls make use of this for more juice15. Samsung paired with mcafee for free malware scan16. Budget-friendly - 24999-3000=21999 - that's the price right now (8/128) with 3k instant bank discount. i got it in a deal of 17k by exchanging RN5 Pro with Rs 7350.CONS:1. No inbuilt dialer call recording feature2. Carrier aggregation support absent (4G+ ?)3. Selfie/front cam quality below the mark but above avg., not spec-wise4. mono, non-stereo speaker o/p - might be a let down for some of you7. Fast charging is till 25W - might be a let down for some8. no screen protector/earbuds bundled with pack. (I purchased both case and guard in 248 -> 149+99 from Amazon and both are fine quality)9. Avg screen refresh rate (60 Hz) - can be a bugger for who's switching from 90/120/120+ Hz10. Gorilla glass 3 - could have been 5+11. Lens assembly area heats up noticeably during prolonged voice calls (fota?)12. LATEST UPDATE: VERY VERY FREQUENTLY SAMSUNG PAY MINI IS AUTO-POPPING UP - FORCING USER TO USE IT - WHILE I WILL NEVER USE IT!13. FORCED GLANCE NOTIFICATIONS - SAME HERE - I WILL NEVER USE SAMSUNG - IF YOU FORCE ME, I'LL ROOT THE PHONE AND REMOVE ALL THOSE SH*T. NO NEED FOR WARRANTY NOW - 1 YEAR OVER!I've tried to be as unbiased and exhaustive as possible. Please set your priorities to buy this model. Mine were ""NON-CHINESE"", budget, battery, camera, processor and UI.AFTER USING FOR 1 YEAR - WRITING ON IT'S 1ST ANNIVERSARY (not manuf., but order date):1. Phone never lags at all - perfect balance between hardware and UI2. Hardly ever fps drop during gaming3. I'm a rough user - dropped phone 4-5 times now from pocket - hardly even a scratch! If I remove my cover and 3D guard, it's a brand new phone! I sanitise my phone (lol) but nothing happened to screen/buttons/ports.4. Glance and Samsung Pay Mini are forced apps that Samsung will force you to use even to an extent that SPay was put autmclly as a shortcut as the navigation home button - but I have my ways around it.5. Selfie cam performance still going strong - usually with same spec MI phones, selfie lens underperforms after a year or so.6. Battery juice is not holding as much as when new - perhaps a more 6000 than 6800mah right now - maybe coz I'm pushing its limits - 201 user apps installed right now and a lot among them are juice-draining.7. Its cost is still INR 21k+ and its cumulative review is 4.4 after 80000 reviews! (as of today - 23 Sept 2021) even after a year of release - tells a lot about cust. satisfctn.If you're looking for a rewarding phone - it's still one of the best BATTERY beast NON-CHINESE option that you have with AWESOME cam performance.",5.0
50,3 months old only and this phone's charging port isn't working. Numerous times calling customer care. The first time they arranged a pick up service with a service centre that doesn't offer this service. 2nd time I got an online appointment with a service centre that doesn't offer this. Waiting a week. Ringing them throughout the day and the call quality is so poor. I can barely hear them. It's a great excuse for Samsung to hang up or put you on hold so they don't have to do their job. Shocking service and I will be letting everyone know on social media.,1.0
51,"I changed from Apple Iphone to M51. The simple reason was battery. During lockdown with WFH situation, battery has become paramount. Continous charging is reducing battery cycles.Ordered on the first day in the first half an hour after reviewing Nord and Realme 7Pro. Samsung as a brand is strong and in the various battery draining and charging test it was reigning supreme over the other two. Though they charge faster but then they have smaller batteries as well.In all other parameters it has been working without a hitch. The processor is strong and is able to load my office apps. I have truly impressed and delighted. Buy blindly if you are looking for a trustable phone which is a workhorse. I also used the HDFC 2000 off offer so got it cheaper.",1.0
52,"Everything is good, but the phone is very heavy. Hand is literally paining after holding it for 30 mins long. It's not a one handed phone definitely. But everything else is good. Not the best.

Really impressive.Gaming is very very smooth, no lag.Battery capacity gave me 2+ days back up for normal usage and for heavy usage 1+ days",1.0

Processor is also very good. No lag while playing games. Phone doesnt heat up while charging or while watching videos or while playing games. It is a complete value for money deal. Got it for INR 22,999 during the first sale promotion offer.The only thing I didnt like is,1. Samsung is not providing any back cover and head phones. The phone is priced at INR 24,999, it should provide these basic things for such costly phone.2. It is overpriced by INR 3000.",5.0

55,Phone is not as expected. Amazon’s return policy is pathetic. Just frustrating to talk to Amazon customer service. Never purchase a phone from Amazon. 7 day return policy is to make fool of consumers. After purchase you can’t even return the product even if it’s faulty. Have been using Amazon prime for so long. Would never buy a phone from Amazon again.,5.0

59,"Firstly how can a phone be available for Rs. 5000 less in just within two months of the launch. This is literally cheating your first buyers for showing confidence in your product.Secondly the battery is so so bad that they should not even mention it in their highlights or promos. If they don't say it is 7000 then there's no way you can conclude its anywhere close to that. Probably the battery optimization is really bad or comoletely missing.Rest Camera is good fingerprint works fine, the phone gets heated when playing heavy games and the samsung keyboard hangs sometimes while typing.Bottomline is 20k is probably a better suited price and next time be more aware of your pricing rather than duping the inital buyers, at least I feel CHEATED.",5.0

65,"I have been using a OnePlus 6 before this and this review is being written considering a little comparison in mind after using for almost 4-5 days.Pros -1- The battery backup is bang on. It lasts for at least 36 hours on moderate usage and for 48 hours on average usage like WhatsApp and social media etc. Charging does take time around 1+ hour (from 0 to 100) but that makes sense considering 7000 mAh huge battery2- Initially I had bad impression on camera but slowly after using and comparing, I am satisfied enough in this price segment. The images captured look real and less digitalised.3- I have had no heating or lagging issues contrary to what some people have written. May be it's an individual unit's issue.4- The low light performance of camera is awesome. Check out on photo captured in during night without using night mode in camera.5- The phone is equipped with good sensors which Samsung has always been good for. The hardware seems pretty decent too and does not give you a feel of plastic (my experience so far)6- It comes with a type C to type C connector which lets you charge your phone from another phone ( I have not used this feature yet though)7- Single shot mode in camera is awesome. It gives you amazing results without having to give multiple pose and clicks.8- Last but not the least, the feel of using the phone is good at this price point. And also, this is equipped with 3.5 mm jack so all your old headphones can still be used with this.Cons-1- Phone is a bit heavier compared to other phones that I used. This is due to the massive battery.2- Touch response is not as great as OnePlus phones that I have used. But good enough to not disappoint you.3- Fingerprint sensor is given on the side edge of phone along with the lock press button. I have faced problems using this and it often does not respond to fingerprints.4- Camera modes are not handy to use. Like if you have to use portrait mode, you need to click on more and then select live focus option. This can be fixed with some future software updates (my suggestion)5- The packaging of the phone does not look premium at all. Very low quality box and prints used. This does not matter though but this is what gives the first impression about a product.6- Just a charger given in the box. Something like a back cover or a screen guard would have been better if given along.Little long review but will give you insights whether you should go for it or not. Also as I have mentioned that I have been using a OnePlus before so people using a premium segment phones can give it a though too. Thanks for reading !",1.0
66,"I purchased an M51 today, and to my surprise the WiFi connectivity was too bad. My 2 year old Honor tablet and all other phones in my house (Realms 5, X2 pro) are giving so much better range in the same place, so no router issue. It is difficult to get decent speed even in the adjacent room to the router. Tried basic troubleshooting by resetting network settings and all but nothing works. Very Disappointed.Also noticed that th signal drops too drastically when I tilt the phone down. I know it happens in all devices to some extent, but here it goes from four bars to just one.",5.0
67,Excellent device.. just go for it.. I didn't find anything bad in this set. Everything is upto satisfaction. Battery backup is wawo and have awesome display.. thanks Amazon for timely delivery and a big clap to Samsung.,5.0
68,"I had started a search for a Samsung phone to replace my well performed Samsung A8 phone. I started by looking for M31, then M31s, and then had a look at M51, which was really not on my radar. But the reviews told me that Snapdragon 730 on M51 works better than Exgynos on M31s. So I read all the reviews of the experts, and decided to go for M51.I was not sure how this product would be, but after using it for the last 5 days, am very happy to say that my fears were unfounded. I ordered it on 18 Sept. 2020, the opening of the sale, and got it delivered 2 days later in perfect and untampered condition. I have a 8Gb 128 Gb blue colored M51.Let's start by the pros1. DisplayThe moment M51 comes to life, after doing the initial formalities, the display on the screen truly blows you away. It's AWESOME, and is clearly a prominent highlight.Another feature is that when you lock the phone, and just click on the side fingerprint button, just to see the time, and not really unlock it, you get a new picture of nature, every single time. The pictures are from all over the world, be it Switzerland, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Indonesia, USA, Canada, Sweden, New Zealand...You name it, beautiful pictures of mountains, rivers, caves, lakes, beaches, islands...It is indeed very picturesque in its beautiful display.Another good feature, is that the Calender displays all the festivals and holidays, so you don't have to search for the upcoming festivals in Google.2. BatteryI was skeptical about the tall claims of Samsung, but after using it since 20 Sept. night, I can clearly say that the claims are true. I am not a heavy game user, so for me, on a single charge, the phone easily lasted 2 days.The 25 W battery charger is truly fast, within a few minutes, you can see that the charging percentage has shot up really fast. So, the battery will take at the most 2 hrs to fully charge.Yet another thing, is that the battery holds on to its own, doesn't drain away just like that. So a single full charge will keep your mind easy.3. SpeedI am not a technical person, so won't go into the specifics of it. All I can say is that the phone is VERY FAST. No lag anywhere. Again, as I am not a heavy game person, so I can't comment on the performance there, but for an average Joe like me, doing day to day office and personal work, with a bit of Landscape game and YouTube movies and videos thrown in, the phone does amazingly well. No hang anywhere.I have a fibre network at home with 100 Mbps speed, both download and upload, and coupled with the features of this phone, uploading even a 70 MB or 80 MB document is very very fast. That was not the case with my previous phone, Galaxy A8 with the same broadband speed.4. PicsI havent taken many pics, so can't really comment there. Have taken a few indoor shots, and the pics came out quite good. Have to do outdoor shoots and selfies, but am expecting them to come out amazing. Hope to post again with pics.5. VideosWith its wide shape, watching a movie or a video on this phone, is really very good. The 6.7 inch screen gives you the best possible viewing. Of course, it can never match the viewing experience on a laptop or a big LED TV, but given that it's a phone, it's very very good. If you plug it to a good Bluetooth speaker, the movie experience is actually amazing.6. WeightThere was a lot of talk regarding the weight, that it's on the heavier side. Shifting from A8, the phone is, yes, a bit heavy, but only a bit. The weight is evenly distributed, so it won't feel heavy after some days of use. At 213 gms, it's still lighter than a thick hardbound book. It is all about how you handle it.7. Size and feelWhat Samsung has done, and I am comparing it with my A8, it has taken up all of the side spaces, and included it in its screen size. So, when I compared the M51 with A8, both from Samsung, side by side, the actual difference in size was not much.A8 has a 5.7 inch screen, M51 has a 6.7 inch screen, but this difference does not mean that the phone size becomes enormous, quite contrary to my fears. With all the side spaces of A8 included in the screen, putting even the front camera inside the screen, the end product is a phone which DOES NOT FEEL LARGE.In fact, anyone who has used a 5.7 inch phone, will not feel that it is bulky, even girls and ladies can use it with ease.8. Fingerprint readerIt is VERY FAST. Samsung claims a time of 0.21 seconds for the fingerprint to operate, and I can tell you that the phone opens up the moment you touch your thumb there. So no issues there.9. SoundThe speaker is quite loud. If you don't want to use earphones, then the speaker does a good job. I have used the speaker mode for calling, as also for seeing videos, and it was loud and clear.Sound is loud and clear during phone calls in normal mode too, so couldn't find any issues there.Cons1. Charging cableIf I have an issue, it's that the length of the charging cable is a bit on the shorter side.Also, the C type charging pin is wider than those of the normal chargers , and so, different from my A8 and other normal Android phones that I have at my home. So it is useless for reverse charging as the charging pin will not fit on any of the Android phones that I have.2. SmudgesIn the reviews that I had seen, a lot has been spoken about the smudges of fingerprints that are left at the back of the phone. And yes, I will concede that.I have the blue phone, and it does leave fingerprints on not just the back, but also the front, but it's OK. Who keeps looking at the back, at least I don't. If I keep it on the table, or bed, I can't see the back. And that's the end of it.On the front, once you switch on the screen, the fingerprints can't be seen in the brilliant display. But in the screen off position, it can be, so you may as well wipe it with a soft and moist cloth.Not so much of a con for me personally.3. LooksThe look is good, but it isn't a wow kind of a phone, or something to show off to your friends. The back gives a glassy look, but the phone itself doesn't have a classy look.But then, it is not an issue for me. For me, the performance matters and so the looks are secondary.Again, not really a con for me.4. PriceAmazon offered a discount of Rs. 2000/- on HDFC cards in the opening 3 days of the sale, so the blue colored 8Gb 128 Gb phone came to 24,999/-. So, as of now, the actual price would be 26,999/-. So that's 1 short of 27k.Many would say the price is on the higher side. If you compare it with similar Chinese made phones of other brands, maybe yeah. But then I was quite clear on going towards Samsung.Its a one time investment, for hopefully the next 3-4 yrs, and yes, I could afford to buy it, so, under the circumstances, I would say that it's a great buy. It will pinch the pocket a bit, as it is above 25k.ConclusionIf you can afford it, and want a non Chinese android or a non Apple brand, then go for it.Eyes closed.",2.0
69,"Bought this phone for like 25k. At this price range no other phone can give this kinda experience. This phone gives more than what i expected from a 20k range device. 730G is so smooth so that it can kinda compete with the the flagships. Camera quality is awesome, 64mp visual is so damn good and the same quality is given for the wide angle, macro too is good in my opinion. In the night time,i say it's above average.not that much best in the class.but with google camera module,it will be alright. and last the battery backup. DAMN!! blew my mind with the 7000mAh!!! and at this price 7000!!! i got around 16hr Screen-on-time and i got to charge the phone for only one time in 2 days. 0 - 100 will be around 1.5 to 2hrs. and for a 7000mAh battery to get charge fully in 2hrs i super awesome compared to all other phones in the world. overall this is a nice package at around 25k. I'm totally satisfied with this device.",1.0
70,"Detailed review--PRICE:-After Getting 2000 Rupees Discount from HDFC Bank Credit Card, Net Cost of phone comes out to be 23118/- (including 118 rupees screen guard), which is a nice deal considering the specs of the phone and brand trust from Samsung.BUILD QUALITY:-Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this amount. I find the large display of the phone is quite good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT:-With Samsung Super AMOLED Plus display you can truly trust the amazing view angle and see the visible difference from Phone Screen of Chinese brand phone. I found it reliable for movie/ Video watching without any distraction and due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on the side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't take a second also to open the phone screen. Even Face Unlock feature is also very fast.BATTERY:-The main benefit of this Phone is its massive 7000mAh battery which gave me enough power for continuous 2 days and still 48% battery is pending.PROCESSOR:-With its blazing fast speed and low battery consumption, I must say, SD 730G with ONE UI optimization works wonderfully for every task. I have not faced even a millisecond lag in Call of Duty or ASPHALT-9  games, even in the high Graphics setting of these games.SOUND QUALITY:-The speaker of this Samsung phone is much improved than earlier Samsung phone J7 Max (as earlier I have used this phone extensively). With Boat headphone, you will experience pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect, the pleasant sound that your ear wants to listen.Finally, Thanks Amazon for Safe and on time delivery of the phone.",1.0
71,"""Samsung M51"" the first 7000mAh battery in Samsung history, a Midrange-Flagship due its premium built quality as well as packed average yet powerful processor and useful features like Knox protection, NFC, WiFi Calling & Dolby Atmos etc. Here goes my verdict after using it for a half month.CAMERA = Felt unexpected Clarity & depth saturated quality in images. Even night mode is average. The 64 megapixel is as it is came out well. Due to developed sensors the image quality is above average well. 64Mp & Macro shots are OSM crisp clear & depth quality. Good at this price.DISPLAY = Truly immersive SuoerAmoled Plus 6.7 inch to your eyes. The punch hole O-Infinity display is delight with 86.6 screen to body ratio is delight for any eyes or movie buffers. The WideScreen makes the movie or video recording amazingly Full filling edge to edge watching experience.BODY/BUILD QUALITY  = A premium body segment. The back is OK glastlic to avoid weight & front has Safe Gorilla glass 3.  No cons here also.BATTERY  = With a monstrous battery 7000mAh, I find it comes for 4 days with less gaming but high gaming means 3 days within. I am still surprised, how Samsung has manage the weight of the mobile it's not feeling bulky hammer in hand. Thank God. Moreover you are getting a 25W Super Fast charger in the box with reverse charging cable C+C types. Means you can charge other mobile with your M51 in case of emergency as PowerBank.CONNECTIVITY = I felt no issues so far. The Call Quality & Video HD Calling, meets the average.  The WiFi Calling is also average clarity thanks to the developers after 1 quick update I got all calls and WiFi Speed more as expected. Some intelligent typing features also added this time in M51.SOUND = I found amazing full bass HD Dolby Atmos sound in the earphone. But the Speaker is loud & clear it is average & mid stereo speaker no complaints for the given budget.PROCESSOR & MEMORY= Packed with 730G new advanced Snapdragon chipset. Ideal for those high end games & multi tasking. I am fully satisfied with its lag free speed tasking. Clock speed of processing task increases more due to LPDDRW4 series of RAM. Internal is 128GB, which can be increased upto 512GB with dedicated memory slot for MSD which can be expanded upto 512gb.My overall experience is fully satisfied with M51, in the given budget. Just Go For it..... My sincere thanks to Amazon & the Seller for safe packed delivery.",1.0

Network/WiFi - 3/5Relatively low range for WiFi (catches less networks) , but once connected the speed was fine. 4g speed is pretty smooth too. No problems whatsoever with call quality.2. Camera - 4/5Haven't used it often enough to really judge it.3. General Performance - 4/5The processor seems good enough to handle normal functioning. Some games seemed to stutter a little but pretty decent overall.4. Build and size- 4/5Contrary to other reviews, I don't find it bulky at all. Looks pretty slick and sturdy at the same time. The 6.7 inch is made possible with a larger screen to device ratio.5. Battery - 5/5Just amazing. Kills everything else with the 7000 mah battery and relatively fast charging time. Lasts for 2 days with light to moderate usage.6. Display - 5/5The best part about this phone. The superamoled shines through and any viewing is a delightful experience. Can't take your eyes off the screen.7. General Intelligence - 2/5This Is where I found the phone lacking compared to others. Some simple accessibility features are not available (eg. Seperate notification sounds for different apps.) But since most such problems can be overcome by 3rd party apps, so not much of an issue.8. Sound - 4/5Deducted one for the poor external speaker output. Sounds excellent on headphones.Overall, a bit pricey but very good phone. Buy it if1. You want to boycott Chinese.2. Have a thing for long battery life3. Multimedia viewingPS: Had earlier received a defected piece with a faulty WiFi which could not pick up signals beyond 5-6 feet.

It is a super amoled plus which consumes less power as compare to other amoled.2. Camera quality is amazing .  64 mp works really good . What I like the most is macro lens . It works so nice and if you use some external lens . Its above best .3. Battery. Does anyone have to say anything about it knowing that it's the only 7000 mah phone . Battery gets full charge within 1.5 hours and can also charge your other devices if needed using reverse charge feature .4. Performance . The performance is very nice . I have over 60 apps on my phone and it run them all smoothly . I also have 2 heavy games . Used to play PUBG and COD and this phone easily run both without lag and with heavy graphic settings .5. It also have separate memory card slot other 2 slim slots and also have a headphone jack unlike Nord and many other phones coming out these days .Overall it is a great phone and infact it is better than Nord and realme x3 in almost every case .",4.4

77,Review from Hardcore samsung user.Terribly upset of this devise. M51 within 2 months some issue with motherboard and interface. Battery was not showing actual 7000 Mah monster show. Am just reaching Mumbai to get ot repaired as phone is dead now. Terribly sad and upset of this mobile.,1.0
78,"After using phone for a week below are the pros and the cons,Pros: -- The design is good and the weight is balanced feels good while operating-- The battery lasts long after full charge.-- The camera quality is very good and many good features to look for.-- The FHD + Super AMOLED+ display do justice to HD videos-- The phone is very fast with  Snapdragon 730G(2.2Ghz 8core processor) and 8GB ram and no over heating problem after playing high graphic games.Cons: -- The phone's battery is 7000 mAh but I think it may be less than that.-- The back is plastic and it may loose its shine so back cover is needed to keep the shine and phone protected.-- no headphones provided and no screen guard for the phone",1.0
79,"One of the best Phones available at present in India at this Price,Whats Good - Great Photo Capture, Looks of the Phone are quite impressive, Battery back up you will never have to worry, Super Amex Plus Glass Display allows best quality Video and Gaming, Speed Ease of Controls are awesome, Super fast Gaming and yet to be experience with licence to go long and play to the fullest with monster Batery.Limitations - Plastic Back but a good Spigen Case can solve this issue.Overall its More than Value for Money",5.0
80,"Chinense manufacturer is far ahead of ssamsung in providing best feature to his customer, after purchssing this samsung M51 I diapponted to see that most of the even basc feature is unavailable in this phone",4.0
81,"I was waiting for this mobile eagerly and bought it as soon as sale started. The Electric Blue is glassy and holds the fingerprints but that's not a problem at all. Let me list down my view after using it for 4 days.1. Battery wise it's definitely an advantage which is lasting longer since it has 7000mAh.2. Another thing I like is the camera clarity. On day light it captures the best. The post processing is very good. On low light it is not great but it will not disappoint.3. Display is good. I am using Infinity O  for the 1st time so having bit trouble seeing the hole while playing the game.4. Processor wise Qualcomm Snapdragon 730G. Even though we are getting better SD processors from other brands(chinese), this doesn't disappoint as it has 2.2GHz, Octa core processor. With 8nm design it's power efficient.5. Before purchase I had doubt if side fingerprint is good or not as I am habituated to back fingerprint, but side is really good and in fact better than side. Only problem I see is it allows only 3 fingerprints to register. If it's more than it will be better.6. Charging wise it's taking little more than 2 hours as wifi/mobile data is on during charge. But 25W charger is definitely helps.7. One more good part is it gives dedicated slot for the expandable memory. So, we no need to sacrifice 2nd sim for it.8. Memory read write speeds are less compared to OnePlus nord but that should be okay if the applications that are running doesn't take more than 6GB/8GB RAM as paging is avoided.9. Software is good. Earlier I am an user of Xiomi and always have fear of data theft or misuse, now with this mobile I don't need to worry about it.Overall I am happy to have this mobile and I recommend it if you are looking in this price segment.",4.0
82,"Everyone knows about Pros,I'm here to point out few limitations of this device..1) accidental ghost touches while typing on virtual keypad holding right hand side of the phone, maybe some sensors are placed there, getting blocked..2) loudspeaker should be louder enough.3) rear camera should have focus locking for moving objects.4) very thin amoled panel, low quality, sensitive to accidental damage, physical breakage.. easily develops cracks, and scratches even on rear side5) no support for carrier aggregation or 4G+",5.0
83,I didn't like this processor with Samsung mobile. Its 8gb ram but damn slow than other samsung exynos 9611 processor. I didn't like the product felt that got defective piece or processor is not good. Tried to call to Amazon customer care they were not responded properly and diagnostic test was not working when I tried. Totally i upset about this handset and with amazon service too. They are not replaced my handset and they were not picked my call. I sold it very less price outside. Totally amazon is giving worst service nowdays.,5.0
84,"Just 1&half month back i got this disaster monster phone...really prove monster for me  in sake of Super anmoled displayed i go with brand now that the reason i hate more now... unfortunately on y 1st slip of phone from hand just 1 feet over sand .... screen got cracked even cover with tempered glass & back cover ... such a disaster of 😪 Rs 7800 i come know when reach service center.... truly pathetic product in term of screen quality its seem like lava & Micromax protection even they r better... 1st & last purchase of me wid samsung, earlier use mi 2 time, 1 time moto ,1 time blackberry, 1 time nokia not face any issue.A phone with 24k should give  complimentary 1time screen replacement or insurance for 1 time damaged.come on Guy's brand k toh lihaz rklo.kya sensitive display bnaye h...If many of u guys still want to go wid samsung..  purchaseinsurance or either keep bum mh dam of Rs 8 to 9k depend on model no.Recommend for Mi for better specifications & same features with lower price in same  segments .",1.0
85,"Well, the product is decent for the price it's offered for. Camera is fantastic, no comments about that.Pros:1. Amazing camera, lots of details in photo, even in night, the quality of photo is really good (when used night mode)2. Videos are crisp and vivid3. Performance is very good, all thanks to snapdragon processor4. Display is mesmerising! Just loved it. One will definitely fall in love with sAMOLED+ display5. Fast chargingCons:1. Phone heats up sometimes2. Even thought they claim that it has 7000mAh battery, it doesn't live up to the expectations. Drains pretty fast. Not sure whether battery is 7kmAh or it is software issue. In both the cases it must be fixed3. Non availability of phone case. Samsung could have provided basic silicon case for phone until the phone cover is made available in the market.4. Secure folder is not available, Samsung pay is missing! Come on, when you are giving all these features in A51 which costs 22k, why not in this phone?5. Highly expexted Alt Z feature is missing.6. Complete knox feature is not availableOverall, a really good phone. Easy to handle, feels really premium, you will definitely fall in love with design and display. Recommended!",1.0
86,Product received  in good condition but stopped working after 45 days. Visited Samsung service centre at Jaipur at Metro piller no 78 Shyam nagar. Samsung Engineer behaviour was so pathetic. He tried his best to avoid warranty liabilities. First he told to visit after 02 days then started pointing out some colour fade on back cover of mobile. After insisting hard n firefighting of 1 hr he agreed to inspect phone internally. Finally no fall impact detected after inspection neither any scratch on phone. They accepted the product for repairing with condition that they will first clarify on the faded back cover then only this will come under warranty. While faded back cover clearly indicates the colour coating/ manufacturing fault. overall Very pathetic experience. Felt like they are treating us as a fraudester Feeling guilty to buy Samsung product.. Samsung need to work on his service centre..What a response from samsung? They have denied the service under warranty due to faded colour on back cover... which is their manufacturing fault.. Very bad experience will never go for Samsung again..,2.0
87,Its been 5 days. At first  the device was performing  good. But later the battery doesn't  last a day so much for its 7k mah. Lot of samsung apps draining  the juice in the background. Poor service /customer  support.Few apps like hotstar doesn't  work. Apps work only over wifi and when connected  on mobile network  the speed is too poor. Thought  it was my network  issue. But when the sim is transferred  to other device download  speed was good. Something  wrong with this device network  is not great.,4.0
88,"My mobile all of sudden went dead and hilarious part is when you think of service under warranty. I have wondered 3 service centers in nearby areas and all I have to hear by engg/executives there is ,""this is common issue in M and A series, the display got damaged on its own and it wont be covered under warranty.""The real eye opener is when you see plenty of customer for same issue and all are just hitting their head on wall hearing this.",1.0
89,The phone is premium looking with great features. The most important factor is the battery which easily has juice for 2days for moderate usage.  The screen is really nice with good depth in the colors and sharp contrast unlike the previous M series.  The camera is impressive with the Sony sensor that provides crisp pictures via both front and rear cameras.  The processor is great with seamless experience during multitasking.  Sound output is commendable as well with clear distinction in shrillness at max volume.  Overall this is a Monster from Samsung!!!,2.0
